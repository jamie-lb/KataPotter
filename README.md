KataPotter
==========

This is my solution to the KataPotter problem on the coding dojo.  The alternate discount is simply calculated
using the average number of books in all sets and there may be room for improvement to the algorithm, but it passes
the test given in the problem as well as others that I've added that have various max discount paths.
